As input data for our model, we used the cereals production, reserves and trade data averaged over three five-year periods (1994-1998, 2001-2005 and 2007-2011), which we refer to by their median years (1996, 2003 and 2009). The evolution of the cereals trade across these three time periods show a decrease of global reserves and an increase in global trade, both expressed as a fraction of total production.

```{r load_trade_data}
years <- c(1996, 2003, 2009)
trade_dat <- lapply(years, get_trade_data, mov_avg = 2,
                    prod_trade_file = "data/cereals_prod_trade.RData", 
                    stocks_file = "data/cereals_stocks.RData")
names(trade_dat) <- years
trade_st <- bind_rows(lapply(trade_dat, get_trade_stats_sum), .id = "year")
kable(trade_st, 
      col.names = c("year", "$\\sum p$ (kcal)", "$\\sum r$ (kcal)", 
                    "# trade links", "$\\sum F$ (kcal)",  
                    "$\\sum r / \\sum p$", "$\\sum F / \\sum p$"),
      caption = paste("Summary statistics of the cereals trade data",
                      "for each time period considered in our analysis"))
```

To separate the effects of changes in reserves and trade flows in our results, we performed two different scalings of the 1996 and 2003 reserves: in the $r$-scaled version, all countries' reserves are scaled by a common factor so that the ratio of total $r$ to total $p$ matches that of 2009; in the $r/s$-scaled version, the reserves are set individually in each country so that the fraction of $r$ to net supply $s$ matches the 2009 data. Compared with the original data, simulation results from these scaled versions allow us to identify the impact of changes in total reserves or in the distribution of these reserves between countries, respectively.

```{r r_scaling}
Rscale <- trade_st$RP_ratio / trade_st$RP_ratio[trade_st$year == "2009"]
trade_Rscaled <- Map(
    function(dat, scal) {
        dat$R0 <- dat$R0 / scal
        dat
    }, trade_dat, Rscale)

S0 <- lapply(trade_dat, function(x) x$P0 + colSums(x$E0) - rowSums(x$E0))
RSscale <- trade_dat$`2009`$R0 / S0$`2009`
trade_RSscaled <- Map(
    function(dat, s0) {
        dat$R0 <- RSscale[names(s0)] * s0
        dat
    }, trade_dat, S0)
```

We define a model run as a set that includes one simulation starting from each country for each of the three years. In addition to the input data (original, $r$-scaled or $r/s$-scaled version), we set three global parameters by model run: the initial shock magnitude as a fraction of the target country's production ($f_p$), the fraction of reserves that are available to absorb a shock ($f_r$), as well as the fraction of a shock absorbed by consumption after reserves are depleted ($f_c$, as defined in our model above). In practice, $f_r < 1$ may reflect the fact that some of the reported reserves are already committed to trade or that countries are unwilling to let reserves drop below some floor amount. 

```{r run_sims}
get_multiyear_sim_results <- function(trade_data, pfrac, rfrac, cfrac) {
    res <- lapply(trade_data, 
                  function(x) sim_allc(pfrac, x$P0, rfrac*x$R0, x$E0, cfrac))
    st <- lapply(res, get_stats_allc)
    trade_stats <- bind_rows(lapply(trade_data, get_trade_stats_by_cty),
                             .id = "year") 
    sim_stats <- bind_rows(lapply(st, get_sim_stats_by_cty))
    cbind(trade_stats, sim_stats)
}

#stats_by_cty <- bind_rows(
#    "02_05"    = get_multiyear_sim_results(trade_dat, 0.2, 0.5, 0.01),

# Appendix: Simulation model details

In our model, we define the annual net supply (or simply "supply") $s_j$ of a food commodity in country $j$ as:
$$s_j = p_j + i_j - e_j \, ,$$ 
where $p$ is production, $i$ is imports and $e$ is exports. The difference between this supply and domestic consumption $c$ must result in a change in the country's reserves $r$, so that: 
$$s_j = c_j + \Delta r_j \, .$$ 
Note that this convention differs from the FAO's definition of domestic supply, which includes a term representing transfer *from* the reserves, whereas a positive $\Delta r$ in our case represents a transfer *to* the reserves. 

We initialize the model with realistic production, trade and reserves data and assume that the initial consumption equals supply (i.e. $\Delta r = 0$ before any shock). The trade data is represented by a matrix $F$ where $F_{jk}$ is the volume of exports from country $j$ to country $k$. 

In the first iteration of the model ($t$ = 1), a supply shock is initiated from a drop in production:
$$ \Delta s'_{1,j} = \Delta p_{j} \, ,$$
where $\Delta p_{j} = 0$ for all but one or a few countries. In the following iterations, $\Delta s'$ will be due to decrease in imports or increase in exports as the shock is propagated through trade. The prime ($'$) notation is used to distinguish different temporary values of the shock within a single iteration. 

At the start of a new iteration, all countries receiving a new shock (form any source) first attempt to absorb it through their reserves:
$$ \Delta r_{t,j} = \max \left( \Delta s'_{t,j}, - r_{t,j} \right) \, . $$ 

Any country that has depleted its reserves (or had none to begin with) will block any increase in its outgoing trade and is thus removed from the set $\mathcal{U}$ (which initially includes all countries).
$$ \mathcal{U} = \mathcal{U} \setminus 
    \left\{ j \mid \Delta s'_{t,j} < - r_{t,j} \right\} \, . $$
    
At this point, countries left with a residual shock absorb a fraction of it ($f_c$) by reducing domestic consumption, leaving an amount $\Delta s''_{t,j}$ that can be transferred to other countries through trade:                 
$$ \Delta s''_{t,j} = \left( \Delta s'_{t,j} - \Delta r_{t,j} \right)
                      \left( 1 - f_c \right) \, . $$ 
To avoid spending a large fraction of the simulation passing tiny residual shocks, we define a fractional threshold $\alpha$ (set at 0.001%) so that countries simply absorb their residual shock when $\lvert \Delta s''_{t,j} \rvert < \alpha \, s_{t,j}$. 

A country can transfer a shock to its trade partners by either reducing its exports or increasing its imports, i.e. by decreasing its balance of trade $b$. We set an upper bound on the magnitude of this change to be equal to the total volume $v$ on all the country's trade links, excluding any "blocked" incoming links:
$$ v_{t,j} = \sum_k F_{t,jk} + \sum_k F_{t,kj} \, \mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{U}}(k)$$ and
$$ \Delta b_{t,j} = \max \left( \Delta s''_{t,j}, - v_{t,j} \right) \, ,$$ 
where $\mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{U}}(k)$ equals 1 if $k$ is in $\mathcal{U}$ and 0 otherwise.  

Each country then changes the trade volume on each unblocked link (- if outgoing, + if incoming) proportionally to the current volume on that link. From this, we can calculate the change of any element of the trade matrix as:
$$ \Delta F_{t,jk} = \left[ \left( \frac{\Delta b_{t,j}}{ v_{t,j}} \right)  
                          - \mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{U}}(j) 
                            \left( \frac{\Delta b_{t,k}}{ v_{t,k}} \right)
                            \right] F_{t,jk} \, .$$

Finally, any portion of the initial shock not absorbed by reserves or passed through trade results in a decrease in consumption:
$$ \Delta c_{t,j} = \Delta s'_{t,j} - \Delta r_{t,j} - \Delta b_{t,j} \, .$$

To start the next iteration, we update the vectors $r$, $c$ and $s$ as well as the trade matrix $F$ based on the computed $\Delta$. Note that the actual change in $s$ for a given country only depends on the fraction of the shock that was absorbed internally:
$$ \Delta s_{t,j} = \Delta r_{t,j} + \Delta c{t,j} \, .$$
The new shock received by each country at the next iteration equal to any increase in exports or decrease in imports due to other countries' actions at this iteration, i.e.:
$$ \Delta s'_{t+1,j} = \sum_k \Delta F_{t,kj} - \sum_k \Delta F_{t,jk} 
                      + \Delta b_{t,j} \, ,$$
where the last term serves to remove the effect of the country's own actions. When $\Delta s'_{t+1, j} = 0$ for all $j$, all shocks have been absorbed internally and the simulation ends.
